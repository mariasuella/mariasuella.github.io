Bringing together expertise from around the UK combined with a case study approach, this project aims to develop robust and transferable understanding of the various
determinants of treescape form and function, how these affect the importance of treescapes for
biodiversity, health and wellbeing, and cultural values, and how these benefits can be enhanced from existing and new treescapes in the face of socio-economic and environmental risks.
This project is part of the <a href= "https://www.uktreescapes.org/" > UK Treescapes </a> programme.
